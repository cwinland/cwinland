### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 25+ years software developer and consultant. About half of that time is with @microsoft.

Solving problems and challenges with code is my passion. Before now, I never published any work, so please keep a look out for new and exciting things. 

Please let me know if you have any ideas! 

In my free time, I'm also a sound engineer and producer. My wife is a professional singer, songwriter, and producer:https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtHb7y9Z3TYoc5VUhfp1KJjpozVjyiKce
 
Together we rule our world!
