I'm a 25+ years software developer and consultant. About half of that time is with [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft).

Solving problems and challenges with code is my passion. Before now, I never published any work, so please keep a look out for new and exciting things. 

Technologies: Azure, Sql Server (and other databases), SharePoint, .NET, Blazor, Angular.

Languages: C#, T-SQL, JavaScript, and many more.

Please let me know if you have any ideas! 

In my free time, I'm also a sound engineer and producer. My wife is a professional singer, songwriter, and producer: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtHb7y9Z3TYoc5VUhfp1KJjpozVjyiKce
